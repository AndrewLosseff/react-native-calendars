`<CalendarList/>` is scrollable semi-infinite calendar composed of `<Calendar/>` components. Currently it is possible to scroll 4 years back and 4 years to the future. All parameters that are available for `<Calendar/>` are also available for this component. There are also some additional params that can be used:

```javascript
<CalendarList
  // Callback which gets executed when visible months change in scroll view. Default = undefined
  onVisibleMonthsChange={(months) => {console.log('now these months are visible', months);}}
  // Max amount of months allowed to scroll to the past. Default = 50
  pastScrollRange={50}
  // Max amount of months allowed to scroll to the future. Default = 50
  futureScrollRange={50}
  // Enable or disable scrolling of calendar list
  scrollEnabled={true}
  // Enable or disable vertical scroll indicator. Default = false
  showScrollIndicator={true}
  ...calendarParams
/>
```
